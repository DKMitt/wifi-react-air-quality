# WiFi Air Quality App with Data Logging

A WiFi Air Quality App with Data Logging intended for indoor air quality monitoring that can detect a wide range of carbon dioxide reading (eCO2) readings and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) such as Alcohols, Aldehydes, Ketones, Organic Acids, Amines, Aliphatic and Aromatic Hydrocarbons.

The WiFi Air Quality App uses an Adafruit CCS811 Air Quality Sensor to take readings in real time and then transmit the data wirelessly via WiFi with the Adafruit Feather HUZZAH ESP8266 WiFi Development Board to a Firebase real-time cloud database, and then displaying the results using a React.js website interface.

### WiFi Air Quality App Description
App & Device can be used to monitor indoor air quality conditions in agricultural, industrial or commercial applications and can be expanded to monitor numerous other types of data according to the need of the clients, market and or by sensors applied to the application. 

Project is to measure the Carbon Dioxide (eCO2) readings and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) readings in real time with sensors and then transmit the data via WiFi to Firebase, a real-time cloud database, and then display the data using a React.JS website interface in real time.

----

### Features to Have:
- Use Firebase (a Backend-as-a-Service cloud storage), to store data on its real-time database to log data of Carbon Dioxide (eCO2) readings and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) readings via WiFi
- Viewable results by a React.JS website interface
- Real time Carbon Dioxide (eCO2) and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) monitoring as polled from sensor 
- Battery powered, portable device
- Battery voltage level indicator

**Please Note:  Sensor Issue with Adafruit CCS811 Air Quality Sensor Breakout Board**

I found an issue while working with the Adafruit CCS811 Sensor that after running for about 15 - 20 minutes the sensor would cause an ERROR and would need to have the ESP8266 rebooted and then it would go back to working until the next crash.

It seems that the CCS811 has clock stretching, which the ESP8266 supports *somewhat*. You can try adjusting the clock stretch timeout or you can try using the SGP30 which is a similar sensor but without the clock stretch issue.

**I was able to fix the problem** by changing the clock stretching setting from being 230 to 460, try what works best for you. I plan on changing out this sensor for the SGP30 or similar to see how it works compared to the CCS811 at some point.

The setting that i changed and worked for me:   twi_setClockStretchLimit(230);  // default value is 230 uS

**Original Settings:**   twi_setClockStretchLimit(230);  // default value is 230 uS

**Changed Settings:**   twi_setClockStretchLimit(460);  // default value is 230 uS
